Revision history for Complete-Module

0.13    2014-12-28 (PERLANCAR)

	- No functional changes.

	- [Bugfix] forgot to avoid emptying @INC in a couple of places.


0.12    2014-12-28 (PERLANCAR)

	- Return hash form of completion answer so path-like completing
	  works.


0.11    2014-12-28 (PERLANCAR)

        - No functional changes.

        - Minor fixes.


0.10    2014-12-28 (PERLANCAR)

	- No functional changes.

	- Adjust tests, don't empty @INC but instead use a unique prefix
	  because emptying @INC will fail on some systems [CT, NANIS].


0.09    2014-12-28 (PERLANCAR)

        - Incorporate all the convenience features from App::PMUtils's
          completion routine to this module (i.e. autoselect path separator,
          shortcut prefixes), so all other modules that might need it can use us
          instead of having to depend on App::PMUtils.

        - Add setting: $OPT_SHORTCUT_PREFIXES.

        [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

        - (Due to importing App::PMUtils' features) default path separator is
          now '/', unless word has '::' or '.' in it.


0.08    2014-12-26 (PERLANCAR)

	- No functional changes.

	- Load B module during testing before emptying @INC, as it's
	  required by new Test::Simple (1.301002+) [CT].


0.07    2014-12-25 (PERLANCAR)

        - No functional changes.

        - Fix typo in test.


0.06    2014-12-25 (PERLANCAR) - â™ª so this is xmas

	- Use Complete::Path to avoid code duplication and gain features like
          expand intermediate path (exp_im_path option) and map case (map_case
          option).

        [REMOVED FEATURES]

        - Remove argument 'separator'. I think this is a misfeature, Perl
          package names should always be separated by '::'. Convenience features
          will be put in App::PMUtils.


0.05    2014-12-24 (PERLANCAR)

	- Follow convention of Complete 0.06.

0.01     2014-06-22 (SHARYANTO)
